# Collaborative Challenges

## Project Title
**Collaborative Challenges - Reward Distribution**

## Project Description
The Collaborative Challenges project is a decentralized platform where teams can collaborate on challenges and receive rewards. A challenge consists of a group of team members, and when the challenge is marked as completed, the rewards are automatically split equally among the team members.

The project is powered by smart contracts, ensuring transparency, fairness, and automation of the reward distribution process. The rewards are distributed only when a challenge is completed, and each team member receives an equal share.

## Project Vision
The vision of Collaborative Challenges is to provide an automated and secure way to reward collaborative work. Whether you're working on coding challenges, creative tasks, or other team-based goals, this platform will ensure that everyone is compensated fairly based on their participation.

### Key Features
- **Challenge Creation:** Only the owner (admin) can create challenges, specifying the team members and reward amount.
- **Team-Based Participation:** Each challenge consists of a team of members, and all members must participate for the challenge to be completed.
- **Reward Distribution:** After the challenge is marked as completed by the admin, the reward amount is automatically split equally among the team members.
- **Security:** Only authorized users (admin or team members) can take actions like completing challenges and distributing rewards.
- **Transparency:** All actions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring full transparency of the reward distribution process.
